## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Our estimation was very close to the actual time spent during the sprint.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Time management is important for the successfulness of the sprint.
  - It is not a good idea to leave some tasks to be completed the day before the demo.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We improved our branch management
  - We improved the way we self-assign tasks to have a more balanced workload
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - /

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Plan better branch merging on GitHub

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We were able to reach the end of the project.
  - We were able to organize as a team despite being scattered all over Italy.

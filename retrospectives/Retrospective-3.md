*We weren't able to find the data about hours estimated for stories 10 and 11 in JIRA beacause they were summed with the hours from previous sprint*

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): 11:15 (avg), 9:10

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table: 1.07

  - Total hours spent: 3:00
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarCloud: 32:00
  - Hours spent on remediation: 3:00
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 1.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ):
    - Reliability: A
    - Security: A
    - Maintainability: A

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - We estimated more correctly this sprint, compared to the previous ones.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - We finished the work sooner, so we were able to better prepare for the demo.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - We were able to better manage our branches on GitHub (but not fully), and our time as a team.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - /

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Perfect branch management.
  - Better self assignment of the tasks.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We didn't fight between each other, and we think it's a good goal.
  - We learned from the mistakes from the previous sprints.
